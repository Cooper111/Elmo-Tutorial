# Elmo-Tutorial

This is a short tutorial on using Deep contextualized word representations (ELMo) which is discussed in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365.
This tutorial can help in using:

**Pre Trained Elmo Model** <br>
**Training an Elmo Model on your new data** <br>
**Incremental Learning** <br>

Visualization of the word vectors using Elmo:

* Tsne
* Tensorboard
